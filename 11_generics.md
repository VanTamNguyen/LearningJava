# Generics and Collections

#### 1. ```hashCode()``` and ```equals()```
Why study ```hashCode()``` and ```equals()``` here? Cause they are essential to working with Java Collections Framework.

* ```equals()``` decides whether two objects are meaningfully equivalent.
    * ```==``` operator just compares two object references. It simply looks at the bits in the variables and verify if they are the same or not.
    * If we don't override 
* ```hashCode()```
